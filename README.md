### **AI Disease Prediction System** 🏥🔍  

The **AI Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict various diseases using patient data. It utilizes trained models for multiple diseases, including **diabetes, heart disease, lung cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and thyroid disorders**.  

🔹 **Features:**  
✅ Predicts multiple diseases using trained ML models  
✅ Uses CSV datasets for training and inference  
✅ Implements data preprocessing and model training in Python  
✅ Provides a **Streamlit-based web interface** for easy interaction  

🔹 **Tech Stack:**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)**  
- **Streamlit (for UI)**  
- **GitHub (for version control)**  

This repository contains **dataset files, trained models, preprocessing scripts, and a web interface** to interact with the prediction system.  

💡 **How to Use?**  
1️⃣ Clone the repository  
2️⃣ Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3️⃣ Run the app (`streamlit run app.py` or `python app.py`)  
4️⃣ Enter patient details and get disease predictions!  

🚀 **Future Enhancements:**  
- Improve accuracy with deep learning models  
- Add more diseases to the prediction system  
- Deploy the application online
